## Abstract

Understanding the characteristics of tourists’ movements is essential for 
tourism destination management. With advances in information and 
communication technology, more and more people are willing to upload photos 
and videos to various social media platforms while traveling. These openly 
available media data is gaining increasing attention in the ﬁeld of movement 
pattern mining as a new data source. In this study, uploaded images and 
their geographic information within Lake Constance region, Germany were 
collected and through clustering analysis, a state-of-the-art k-means with 
noise removal algorithm was compared with the commonly used DBCSCAN on 
Instagram dataset. Finally, association rules between popular attractions at 
region-level and city-level were mined respectively. Results show that 
social media data like Instagram constitute a valuable input to analyse 
tourists’ movement patterns as input to decision support and destination 
management.
